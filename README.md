# RC-payload-SUCHAI
This repository has the software used in the RC payload in SUCHAI projects (SUCHAI1 and SUCHAI 2/3). This contains the firmware onboard of SUCHAI and the data processing scripts of the telemetry, that were used to compare the results between space and earth measurements..

*The experiment for SUCHAI 2/3 is not developed yet, so only simulation scripts are provided.*
